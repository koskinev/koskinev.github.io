title: A Rust RNG with atomically updating state
---

{% include enable_mathjax.html %}

I've been working on a simple PRNG that requires only an immutable reference is to use:

```rust
use randy::Rng;

// Create a new RNG
let rng = Rng::new();

// A function that takes a reference to the RNG
// 
//        not &mut ðŸ‘‡!
fn find_answer(thoughts: &Rng) -> Option<u64> {
    match thoughts.random() {
        42 => Some(42),
        _ => None,
    }
}

assert!(find_answer(&rng).is_none());
```

Neat, huh? No more passing around mutable references to the RNG! You can even make it a static, like this:

```rust
static RNG: LazyLock<Rng> = LazyLock::new(Rng::new);
```

This is possible by making the RNG's state atomic.

## Implementation

The RNG is based on iterating its state over the [Weyl sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_sequence) $x_i = x_{i-1} + c \mod 2^{64}$, and hashing the previous state with [wyhash](https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash). The state is stored in an [`AtomicU64`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicU64.html):

```rust
pub struct Rng {
    /// The current state of the RNG.
    state: AtomicU64,
}
```

And it is updated with a single `fetch_add` operation, followed by a call to `wyhash`:

```rust
impl Rng {
    /// The increment for the Weyl sequence.
    const INCREMENT: u64 = 0x9E3779B97F4A7FFF;

    /// Returns the next `u64` value from the pseudorandom sequence.
    fn u64(&self) -> u64 {
        // Read the current state and increment it
        let old_state = self.state.fetch_add(Self::INCREMENT, Ordering::Relaxed);

        // Hash the old state to produce the next value
        wyhash(old_state)
    }
    ...
}

#[inline]
fn wyhash(value: u64) -> u64 {
    // These constants, like the `INCREMENT` constant, are coprime to 2^64.
    const ALPHA: u128 = 0x11F9ADBB8F8DA6FFF;
    const BETA: u128 = 0x1E3DF208C6781EFFF;

    let mut tmp = (value as u128).wrapping_mul(ALPHA);
    tmp ^= tmp >> 64;
    tmp = tmp.wrapping_mul(BETA);
    ((tmp >> 64) ^ tmp) as _
}
```

And that's it!

## Quality and performance

I think the RNG is okay. It isn't cryptographically secure, but it passes [PractRand](http://pracrand.sourceforge.net/) pre0.95 at least up to 256 GB of generated data (I didn't have the patience to run it longer). In terms of speed, there is a penalty for using atomics. On my machine, the throughput of the atomic RNG is about 3.7 GB/s, compared to 7.7 GB/s for a variant that uses a mutable reference and no atomics. You can check out the [repository](https://github.com/koskinev/randy) on GitHub if you want to run the tests yourself.

## Code

A minimal implementation is just under 60 lines of code. You can try it on the [Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&code=use+std%3A%3Async%3A%3A%7Batomic%3A%3A%7BAtomicU64%2C+Ordering%7D%2C+LazyLock%7D%3B%0Ause+std%3A%3Ahash%3A%3A%7BBuildHasher%2C+RandomState%7D%3B%0A%0Apub+struct+Rng+%7B%0A++++%2F%2F%2F+The+current+state+of+the+RNG.%0A++++state%3A+AtomicU64%2C%0A%7D%0A%0Astatic+RNG%3A+LazyLock%3CRng%3E+%3D+LazyLock%3A%3Anew%28Rng%3A%3Anew%29%3B%0A%0A%23%5Binline%5D%0Afn+wyhash%28value%3A+u64%29+-%3E+u64+%7B%0A++++%2F%2F+These+constants%2C+like+the+%60INCREMENT%60+constant%2C+are+coprime+to+2%5E64.%0A++++const+ALPHA%3A+u128+%3D+0x11F9ADBB8F8DA6FFF%3B%0A++++const+BETA%3A+u128+%3D+0x1E3DF208C6781EFFF%3B%0A%0A++++let+mut+tmp+%3D+%28value+as+u128%29.wrapping_mul%28ALPHA%29%3B%0A++++tmp+%5E%3D+tmp+%3E%3E+64%3B%0A++++tmp+%3D+tmp.wrapping_mul%28BETA%29%3B%0A++++%28%28tmp+%3E%3E+64%29+%5E+tmp%29+as+_%0A%7D%0A%0Aimpl+Rng+%7B%0A++++%2F%2F%2F+The+increment+for+the+Weyl+sequence.%0A++++const+INCREMENT%3A+u64+%3D+0x9E3779B97F4A7FFF%3B%0A%0A++++%2F%2F%2F+Initializes+a+new+RNG.%0A++++pub+fn+new%28%29+-%3E+Self+%7B%0A++++++++let+seed+%3D+RandomState%3A%3Anew%28%29.hash_one%28%22foo%22%29%3B%0A++++++++let+state+%3D+AtomicU64%3A%3Anew%28seed%29%3B%0A++++++++Self+%7B+state+%7D%0A++++%7D%0A%0A++++%2F%2F%2F+Returns+the+next+%60u64%60+value+from+the+pseudorandom+sequence.%0A++++pub+fn+random%28%26self%29+-%3E+u64+%7B%0A++++++++%2F%2F+Read+the+current+state+and+increment+it%0A++++++++let+old_state+%3D+self.state.fetch_add%28Self%3A%3AINCREMENT%2C+Ordering%3A%3ARelaxed%29%3B%0A%0A++++++++%2F%2F+Hash+the+old+state+to+produce+the+next+value%0A++++++++wyhash%28old_state%29%0A++++%7D%0A%0A%7D%0A%0Afn+main%28%29+%7B%0A++++%2F%2F+A+function+that+takes+a+reference+to+the+RNG%0A++++%2F%2F+%0A++++%2F%2F+++++++++++++not+%26mut+%F0%9F%91%87%21%0A++++fn+find_answer%28thoughts%3A+%26Rng%29+-%3E+Option%3Cu64%3E+%7B%0A++++++++let+idea+%3D+thoughts.random%28%29%3B%0A++++++++println%21%28%22Got+%7Bidea%7D%22%29%3B%0A++++++++match+idea+%7B%0A++++++++++++42+%3D%3E+Some%2842%29%2C%0A++++++++++++_+%3D%3E+None%2C%0A++++++++%7D%0A++++%7D%0A++++assert%21%28find_answer%28%26RNG%29.is_none%28%29%29%3B%0A%7D):
